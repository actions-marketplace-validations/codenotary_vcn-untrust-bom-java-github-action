# vcn-untrust-bom-java-github-action

GitHub action that uses the **[vcn](https://github.com/codenotary/vcn)** tool from CodeNotary.com to untrust the bill of materials (BoM) for Java (Maven) projects. It accepts directories or JARs containing a pom.xml file as input.

## How to use it

Have a look in the provided [example workflow](.github/workflows/example.yml).

:bulb: The underlying vcn Docker image can also be run directly (an example is also provided in the same [example workflow](.github/workflows/example.yml)). This way one can **specify any vcn** :boom: flag, not just the ones exposed by the GitHub action.
